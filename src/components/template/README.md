# TEMPLATE COMPONENTS

> âš  **This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains the Template Components. These components used in the top-level layout (like `header` or `footer`)

There are some points about components in this directory:
1. Their names must start with `The` prefix (Like TheFooter).
2. They must be used in the top-level layout.
3. They aren't global components so we need to import them inside our layout.
